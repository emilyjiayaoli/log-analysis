1) Install Python 3.10 or newer. https://www.python.org/downloads/

2) Open cmd/terminal and type:
```
pip install ursina
```


If you want to install the newest version from GitHub, you can install like this.
```
pip uninstall ursina
pip install https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina/archive/master.zip
```


Keep in mind that things *could* break.


If you want to easily edit the source, it's recommended to clone the git
repo and install as develop like this. Make sure you have git installed. https://git-scm.com/
```
git clone https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina.git
pip install --editable .
```

Also install any of the optional dependencies you want from the list below,
or install them all with:
```
pip install ursina[extras]
```


On some systems you might have to use pip3 instead of pip in order to use Python 3 and not the old Python 2.
If the pip command is not found, you can use:
```
python -m pip install ursina
```
